### Happy address

Proof of concept to use browser geolocation and geolocation to fill out address forms. Classic address forms have `select` inputs which are frustrating to use, especially on mobile. Happy browser allows a user to enter an address as text without changing contexts across form elements, and lets the computers figure out the parsing and validating.

### Demo

- locally (best option) - `npm install && npm start` to run
- heroku (not good, because Google Maps API is maxed out on Heroku) https://happy-address.herokuapp.com/
